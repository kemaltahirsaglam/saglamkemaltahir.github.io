    <h4>BAYKAR Technologies (01.08.2022 - 16.09.2022)</h4>
    <p><b class="bas">City</b> : İstanbul <b class="bas">Country</b> : Türkiye <b class="bas">Field(s) of study</b>
        :
        Touch Systems and Interface
        Development</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have concluded a comprehensive <i>40-day</i> internship with the <b>Touch Systems and Interface
            Development</b>
        Team within the <b>Human Machine Interactive Software Technologies</b> Unit at <i>Baykar</i>. <br>
        Over the course of this internship, I engaged in an in-depth exploration of various facets of software
        development that are highly pertinent to the field. <br>
        During my tenure, I delved into the intricate software architecture of <b>Linux</b>, gaining insights into
        its structure and functionality.<br> I also acquired practical experience in working with <b>SystemD</b>, a
        crucial
        component in modern Linux-based systems. <br>
        My responsibilities encompassed the design of interfaces and applications tailored for specific target
        devices,
        including <i>Toradex</i>, <i>Nvidia</i>, and <i>Raspberry Pi</i>.<br> This task allowed me to hone my skills
        in
        crafting user-friendly and efficient software solutions. <br>
        Furthermore, I had the privilege of working with the <b>Qt</b> platform, a versatile framework renowned for
        its
        capabilities in creating graphical user interfaces. <br>
        Additionally, I delved into the <b>b2qt</b> <i>(Boot-to-Qt)</i> method, expanding my knowledge of software
        development methodologies.</p>
    <h3>Automotive and Embedded Development Intern</h3>
    <img src="abi.jpg">
    <h4>Abinsula (01.08.2023 - 01.10.2023)</h4>
    <p><b class="bas">City</b> : Sassari <b class="bas">Country</b> : Italy <b class="bas">Field(s) of study</b> :
        Automotive Product Development</p>
    <br>
    <p>During my 45-day internship at <i>Abinsula</i>, I gained valuable experience in automotive and embedded
        development. <br>
        Throughout this internship, I had the opportunity to delve into critical aspects of the automotive industry,
        including <b>ADAS</b> <i>(Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)</i> and <b>ISO26262</b> standards. <br>
        My primary task at <i>Abinsula</i> was focused on testing a MIPI CSI-2 Camera, intended for use as a parking
        camera in <i>Ferrari</i> vehicles. <br>
        My responsibilities included designing a suitable <b>PCB</b> <i>(Printed Circuit Board)</i> using
        <b>KiCad</b> to
        establish a connection between the camera's deconnector and the evaluation board.<br> This connection was
        vital
        for
        supplying power to the MIPI CSI-2 camera and other essential components. <br>
        Additionally, I was tasked with compiling an image file for the <i>Apalis iMX8</i>, which serves as the
        microprocessor for the evaluation board, enabling it to function effectively. <br>
        In the process of designing the new PCB, I utilized technologies such as <b>FPD-Link III</b>, <b>CAN</b>
        <i>(Controller Area Network)</i>, and <i>D-PHY</i> to ensure a robust and efficient connection. <br>
        When it came to creating the image file for the target device, I relied on the <b>Yocto Project</b>, <b>Bash
            Scripting</b> and <b>UART</b> <i>(Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)</i> techniques,<br> all
        of
        which
        are widely employed in the
        automotive field.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <img src="tubitak1.jpg">
    <h3>Graduation Project (01.02.2023 - 12.06.2023)</h3>
    <h4>2209-B Industry Oriented Research Project Support Programme for Undergraduate Students - Stress Alert System
        <br>Graduation Project Support
    </h4>
    <p>The structure of Stress Alert System consist of embedded software, medical electronics, signal processing and
        data analysis. <br>
        Aim of the project is observing the physiological changes on the individual with the help of <b>GSR</b>
        (Galvanic
        Skin
        Response) and <b>PPG</b> (Photoplethysmography) sensors. <br>
        Differences from today's stress-based products are that it uses both elements in a hybrid way and has an
        application that is in interactive communication with the user. <br>
        My role in the project is to design an interface and application that makes the output more meaningful and
        digital.<br> With the interface and application compiled on the Raspberry Pi 3 device, a
        result close to the products on the market was obtained.</p>
